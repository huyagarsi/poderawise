That’s it. That’s the story.”</p><h2>What has Fetty Wap said about his eye?</h2><p>Many would be unsettled and distressed by the loss of their eye.</p><p>But don’t think that is the case of Fetty.</p><p>In that same 2015 interview, the Trap Queen rapper made it cleat that he had no qualms about it.</p><p>“I’m probably one of the first <a href=#>rappers</a>/singers to come on the scene with one eye and be comfortable with it”, he told DJ Self.</p><p>He then went on to talk about people’s reactions to him loosing his eye at an early age.</p><p>“A lot of people are judgemental, but it’s all on how you show yourself to the people.”</p><p>“That’s probably one of the main things people won’t know about me until they see me.”</p><p>Although he was provided with a prosthetic eye following the incident, Fetty decided to get rid of it during his teenage years, after becoming more and more comfortable with his disability.</p><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Tupac fans spread conspiracy rapper is ALIVE after TikTok lookalike emerges 25 years after his death</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp52utXnHmqepnZ6asW7Azmadnqykrnq4rc%2BsZJ6xlWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-joe-burrow-dad-in-a-wheelchair-is-jim-burrow-sick-what-happened-to-him-health-update.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Joe Burrow Dad In A Wheelchair?

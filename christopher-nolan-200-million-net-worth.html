It is extremely difficult for a director to become a household name since directors never appear on screen where filmgoers can see them. He is the man behind the creative vision for several hit films, including the entire <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Batman franchise</a> starring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Bale</a> and Michael Caine, and inventive&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">psychological thrillers</a> like Inception and Interstellar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He writes, produces, and directs films that force movie-goers to think and discuss their interpretations of the films they've just seen. His films stay with people years after they’ve seen them. Inception came out a decade ago and people are still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">debating its ending</a>.</p><p>While other directors rely on special effects, common themes for relating to the audience, and linear narratives, Nolan pushes the format by exploring unconventional, non-linear timelines and metaphysical themes.</p><p>Nolan writes for an audience that is smarter than most studios give them credit for.</p><h2 id=writing><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Writing</span></h2><p>Christopher Nolan is an Academy Award-nominated writer. For his writing, he has been nominated for Best Original Screenplay twice. The first nomination was in 2001, for his film, Memento, a psychological thriller. The second time he was nominated was nearly a decade later, for Inception, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Nolan has written over eighteen films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=interstellar><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Interstellar</span></h2><p>Nolan wrote, directed, and produced the hit sci-fi film, Interstellar, starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and a relatively unknown (at the time) Timothée Chalamet. McConaughey and Hathaway portrayed astronauts who were trying to save the human race. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards and took home the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.</p><h2 id=the-dark-knight-rises><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Dark Knight Rises</span></h2><p>In 2012, Nolan finished out the Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises. He was hesitant to make another Batman film, but he felt he should end the series on a high note. With the success of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, the studio would have made a third film with or without Nolan. Nolan wrote, directed, and produced this film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Batman: Here's How Much The DC Hero Has Changed Since 1939</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dunkirk><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dunkirk</span></h2><p>Dunkirk is known as the film that starred Harry Styles. The film also stared Fionn Whitehead, Tom Hardy, Jack Lowden, and James D’Arcy, but most people remember Harry Styles. The film was about the Dunkirk evacuation during World War 2. It was the first war film teenage girls wanted to see.</p><h2 id=directing><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Directing</span></h2><p>Nolan has directed fifteen films and is an Oscar-nominated director. The first film he directed was called Tarantella. That&nbsp;was a television short he wrote and produced. After, he directed two more short films, before doing his first full-length feature in 1998, which was called Following. After Following, he gathered enough of a following to make his breakout film, Memento.</p><h2 id=tenet><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tenet</span></h2><p>Nolan’s next film to be released is a spy thriller called Tenet, which is currently in post-production. The film has a star-studded cast, including John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Michael Caine, Elizabeth Debicki, and many more. This spy thriller is about a secret agent who is trying to prevent World War III.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Christopher Nolan's Release Of 'Tenet' Is The Hope Of The Movie Industry</a></span></p><h2 id=man-of-steel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Man Of Steel</span></h2><p>While Nolan and fellow director, writer, and producer, David S. Goyer, were working on The Dark Knight Rises, Goyer brought up his idea for a new Superman film. Nolan was impressed and excited about the idea and pitched it to Warner Brothers. While the screenplay was written by Goyer, Nolan produced the film and was given credit for the story.</p><h2 id=producing><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Producing</span></h2><p>Nolan usually writes, directs, and produces all of his own projects. In his career, there have only been five projects he has produced which he has not directed or written. Since he produced and was credited with the story for Man of Steel, he has gone on to be an executive producer for the entire franchise.</p><h2 id=inception><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Inception</span></h2><p>In 2010, Nolan released his hit film, Inception, starring Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and of course, Leonardo DiCaprio. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four of them. Many fans saw the film multiple times, trying to understand the ending. Many of them remained confused.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=batman-begins><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Batman Begins</span></h2><p>In 2003, Nolan had a meeting with Warner Brothers about relaunching the Batman franchise. Nolan was a fan of the comics but wanted to make the film more of a drama, placing it into a relatable world, rather than one of fantasy. Many consider his version of Batman the best to date.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Awesome Batman Facts The Movies Didn't Show Us</a></span></p><h2 id=awards><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Awards</span></h2><p>Christopher Nolan has been nominated many times and has won a lot of awards in his career. He has been nominated two hundred and twenty-three times for his films and has won one-hundred and thirty-seven times. He has been nominated for five Oscars but has yet to take home the coveted trophy.</p><h2 id=memento><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Memento</span></h2><p>In 2000, Nolan directed, produced, and wrote the screenplay for his breakout film, Memento. His brother pitched the idea of a man avenging his wife’s murder, except he has amnesia. Nolan received his first Oscar nomination for the film. It was recently announced he would be rebooting the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-dark-knight><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Dark Knight</span></h2><p>The Dark Knight was the second film in Nolan’s Batman franchise. Thanks to Heath Ledger’s phenomenal performance as the Joker, it is considered to be one of the best films (and superhero films) ever made. This meant that making the last film in the franchise, The Dark Knight Rises, was a daunting task.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Reportedly Wants Christopher Nolan For The New Daredevil Movie</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGwvMeeqWamn6Gur3mRaWdmpZmhuaq7zWalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-who-inherited-john-waynes-money-after-he-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Who Inherited John Wayne's Money After He Died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-dancevic-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-494763-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Dancevic Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

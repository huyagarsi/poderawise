Former President Donald Trump had a contentious relationship with black America. Though he would say things to the public such as believing in equal rights for all, he made many statements that were deemed racist by an overwhelming majority of the public.</p><p>After delivering a speech on January 6, 2021, that inspired thousands to march over to the U.S. Capitol shouting ‘Stop the Steal’ that ultimately resulted in rioters breaking in while some carried the Confederate flag, Trump spent his last days in the Presidential office out of the spotlight. He certainly didn’t preside over any official services honoring Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>In honor of Martin Luther King Jr., celebrities joined together for a virtual, star-studded celebration in music, word, and song where they reflected upon Dr. King’s message and legacy. The event is called United We Serve: A Celebration of the National MLK Day of Service. Celebrities who participated include the following: &nbsp;Rev. Dr. Bernice King, Martin Luther King III, <a href=# title="Aloe Blacc Says Misogyny Will Never Leave Hip-Hop"><strong>Aloe Blacc</strong></a>, Chesca, Rep. Sharice Davids, Rosario Dawson, Andra Day, Yo-Yo Ma, Rev. Al Sharpton, Sean Patrick Thomas, Diane Warren, Lynn Whitfield, Bebe Winans, and more.</p><p>You may watch the full video of United We Serve: A Celebration of the National MLK Day of Service in the video player below.</p><p></p><p>The organization Black Lives Matter was outspoken about Donald Trump’s administration and participated in numerous protests across the country after high-profile cases of police brutality under Donald Trump’s America. The death of George Floyd left the nation in shambles as protesters took to the streets to raise their voices against police brutality amid the Coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A small group of Black Lives Matter protesters was seen carrying signs at Black Lives Matter (BLM) Plaza Northwest located in Washington, D.C. The groups stood by to watch Donald Trump and Melania Trump <a href=# rel=noopener>leave the White House</a> for the final time.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about the first day of the <a href=# title="Will The Democrats Decriminalize Marijuana? – Kamala Harris Says She And Joe Biden Want To"><strong>Joe Biden</strong></a> administration so far?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenlsGktIysq5qqXajBtrDDnptmrZ6ewaawjLCcZquVp8OmecBmmp6klZe%2FosDIqKVmp5ZiwamxjKeYraGfo66tecylomacka56sLKMrJyrrpmYsm60xKWbZpqpYsGpsYyboJ2dnmKupbnIp6CsrKKWwaq7zWZrcGllbX1w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What came first the chicken or the ___?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nancy-leigh-kelley-bio-net-worth-personal-life-career-twitter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nancy Leigh Kelley, Bio, Net Worth, Personal Life, Career, Twitter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

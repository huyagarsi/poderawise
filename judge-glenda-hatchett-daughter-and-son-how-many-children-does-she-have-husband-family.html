When doctors eventually operated on her, they found a large amount of blood inside her abdomen.</p><p>Following the death of his wife, Johnson filed a wrongful death lawsuit claiming doctors neglected the health condition of the patient and sought damages.

Sadly, she could not survive the heavy blood loss and was pronounced dead at 2.22 am.

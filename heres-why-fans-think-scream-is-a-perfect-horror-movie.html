For many people, the 1996 film Scream is the best in the genre, and there are many reasons why people are still so obsessed with this scary story.</p><h2 id=sidney-prescott-39-s-character>Sidney Prescott's Character</h2><p>Scream has a 79% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer and a 79% Audience Score, which is really good, many of the audience reviews on the website are really positive. There are many fan theories about the movie, including the <a href=#>fan theory that Dewey is Ghostface</a>, and they're always fun to read because this movie truly never gets old.</p><p>For many fans of Scream, it's a beloved horror movie because of the character of Sidney Prescott.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan explained in a Reddit thread</a>, "It's perfect to me and my personal favorite, so yes. There's not a thing I'd change about it even if it wasn't at the top of my list. Nobody can deny its legendary status and the impact that it had. Sidney has always been my favorite final girl because I've always found her to be the most realistic, tough, likeable, and inspirational. She's just the perfectly written character and the way the Scream films were made allowed us to also get a true understanding of her as a person outside of all of the action, she's more well rounded than most."</p><p>It's definitely true that Neve Campbell's character makes the movie really special. From the very start, audiences are interested in Sidney, hoping that she'll be able to move on from her mom's terrible murder. Audiences feel sympathetic that her boyfriend Billy is pressuring her and love watching her with her funny best friend Tatum. And before too long, when she's being chased by Ghostface, fans want nothing but to see Sidney survive and succeed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Scream' Featured This Brilliant Wes Craven Easter Egg Nobody Notice</a></span></p><h2 id=a-new-story-for-the-slasher-genre>A New Story For The Slasher Genre</h2><p>While many have seen Scream so many times that they're totally used to the premise and the sense of humor that it has, it's true that it felt so new, fresh, and unique when it first came out in movie theaters, and it's good to remember how much it did for the genre.</p><p>Fans also love the unique and inventive way that Scream took on the slasher genre. According to one fan review on Rotten Tomatoes that in their eyes, the film is "Genre breaking, starting, redefining, not sure the right word, but it was a great new wave horror slasher film, still is."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others praised the fact that the story is both hilarious and scary, with another audience review calling it "A love letter to the slasher genre that revitalized horror. Filled with twists and turns with plenty of scares."</p><p>Another fan praised Scream on Reddit, saying that it's amazing because it can be a homage to other horror movies but it's also a fresh take. The fan mentioned Randy's obsession with the genre and his explanation of the rules, which is a classic and beloved part. The fan wrote, "It parodies horror movies and pays tribute to past slashers and iconic horror movies without being ham-fisted or turning into a comedy" and said it was a "nice touch" that Randy had so much to say about the genre.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is The Inspiration Behind The New 'Scream' Movie Coming In 2022?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other fans shared on Reddit that Scream gets into its characters instead of just introducing them briefly and then having them murdered, which is definitely a good point. Fans know that Tatum is bold and funny, Dewey is sweet but a bit lost, and Gail is determined to get the story out no matter what.</p><p>Neve Campbell shared her feelings about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joining the Scream franchise again</a> and according to Comicbook.com, she said on The Talk, "Oh you guys, I'm 47 and I'm going to be covered in blood.

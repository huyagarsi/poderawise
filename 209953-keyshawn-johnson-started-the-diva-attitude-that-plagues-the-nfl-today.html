His outrageous remarks during the 2003 season caused an argument on the sideline with Jon Gruden that was seen by millions of people, this caused Gruden to deactivate Johnson for the remainder of the season until he was then traded to the Cowboys.</p><p>Another memorable off-field moment was in 2004 when Johnson called out former Bucs teammate Ronde Barber and referred to him as "Uncle Tom."</p><p>These are just a few of the most memorable moments of Johnson being a diva and there are plenty to other moments including excessive fines, throwing down his helmet during games (which was the result of the NFL creating a new rule), and just showing his cocky attitude throughout various games.</p><p>Johnson even commented on his paving the path of diva receivers by saying, "[In 1996,]I was the queen of the ball, the princess, whatever. And all those guys have come after me."</p><p>"I wrote the book on diva receivers. Truly, when you break it all down, I'm the first guy in the last 15 years of receivers who did all that stuff. I threw my helmet to the ground when no one was doing that."</p><p>Now we have to deal with TO overdosing, Braylon Edwards calling out the Browns fans, Brandon Marshall and his off the field issues, Ochocinco running his mouth and making predictions, Matt Jones partying way too hard with illegal drugs, Donte' Stallworth drunk driving and killing a man, and <a href=#>Plaxico Burress</a> shooting himself in the leg.</p><p>The diva attitude needs to stop.</p><p>Why can't these guys take notes from <a href=#>Randy Moss</a> on how to grow up, mature, and stay out of trouble? (Moss wasn't an angel earlier in his life.)</p><p>It's a shame these guys think they can get away with their attitudes, because NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is about to lay down some law with some pending suspensions that look to be extremely lengthy. Hopefully, Goodell can stop this ridiculous circus sooner than later.</p><p>Thanks, Keyshawn; thanks a lot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaWlxaWqAbrfEsqqhmaejequ7x6eqqKZdqMGivtOem2asmJp6pbXVmmSarKSewbawxGaroZmkYr2trcaunKxlpJ2ybrrFpWStp5SWxg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rob Dyrdek News - Us Weekly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jena-friedman-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jena Friedman Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

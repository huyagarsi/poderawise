Article originally written in February 2021.</i></p><p>This article was updated on January 4, 2022.</p><p>Fashion fact: Wearing an elegant pair of <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> can completely transform your outfit and make you feel more put together. We’re huge fans of ear accessories, and we have the packed jewelry boxes to prove it! But unfortunately, for some shoppers, wearing a pair of earrings isn’t as easy or uncomplicated as it is for others. One word — allergies.</p><p>Certain metals just don’t mesh well when they come into contact with sensitive skin types, but there is a solution to this issue! We’re here to help you out if you’re looking for earrings that won’t irritate your skin — plus explain what to look for and how to shop smarter. We’ve found tons of earrings that are made from metals which are hypoallergenic, and therefore less likely to cause any type of redness or other irritation when you wear them. Oh, and our picks are all incredibly affordable to boot!</p><h2>Our Top Picks:</h2><h2>What are hypoallergenic earrings?</h2><p>The suggestions we have laid out for you below are a great starting point if you’re in the market for hypoallergenic earrings, but we also want to explain how we came to these picks. In many cases, inexpensive jewelry is made with nickel. This is a super sturdy metal that’s cheap to produce, so naturally, lots of different brands use it in their jewelry. The only problem? Well, nickel is one of the worst metals that can come into contact with your skin if it’s sensitive. In fact,<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;the CDC estimates</a> that as much as 20% of the country’s population is allergic to nickel — so if you’ve noticed that your ears get red or itchy while wearing a pair of earrings, it may very well be due to the presence of the metal. Hypoallergenic earrings are designed to help by using metals known to cause less extreme reactions.</p><h2>What materials are best for sensitive skin?</h2><p>Before we added the below earrings to our round-up, we made sure to check which metals they’re made from. The best metals to look for are surgical steel, sterling silver or platinum. Gold is also a strong option, but it’s slightly trickier. In some cases, gold can have small traces of nickel — which is mixed in to make the metal itself more durable. If your skin is ultra-sensitive, that is something to consider while shopping. But if you do want to buy gold jewelry, check to see if it’s nickel-free if you’re concerned about allergic reactions. And if you’re shopping for gold-plated jewelry, make sure that the base metal isn’t nickel. Also, beware of stainless steel — it’s a metal that’s made with nickel, and while it sounds safe, it can definitely cause an allergic reaction.</p><p>We hope this information helps you out while shopping for earrings that won’t trigger your skin. So, let’s get to the fun part — actually shopping! Check out all of our favorite picks below and add them to your collection with the confidence that you can wear each pair with ease!</p><h2>10 of the Best Earrings for Sensitive Ears</h2><p><strong>These Genuine Diamond Studs</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Amazon-Collection-Diamond-Stud-Earrings-1.png><p>These are timeless diamond studs set in sterling silver.

The report stated that Khan is keen to bring Punk back to the company and that there are many complex issues that need to be addressed before any deal can be struck.</p><p>Following <a href=#>Punk’s Instagram post</a>, which has since been deleted, several individuals have speculated that a reconciliation was not likely. However, Meltzer has suggested that it could still happen.</p><p>In the post, Punk wrote about his matches against Jon Moxley in the summer of 2022. It is believed that this post may have been a sign that Punk is willing to return to the wrestling ring.</p><p>Tthe host of Jim Cornette’s podcast <a href=#>Brian Last circulated an excerpt from AEW’s talent handbook</a>, which outlines the company’s policy on public criticism of fellow team members. The policy prohibits public statements that accuse or criticise fellow team members or the organization as a whole.</p><p>It also includes a section on social media, advising wrestlers to check with those they are working with before posting anything that could advance storylines. The handbook also suggests running posts past coaches or members of the legal, HR or PR teams before posting.</p><p>“Public Criticism of Fellow Team Members. AEW policy prohibits public criticism of fellow team members. Such prohibited public statements may include, but are not limited to: Accusations or criticism of fellow team members or the organization as a whole. Accusations or criticism of tactics/style of wrestling of fellow team members. Accusations or suggestions that certain issues consistently occur in a particular match. Innuendos and indirect statements will also be considered prohibited. While understanding that social media can be used to help advance storylines, first please check with those with whom you are working before posting. Feel free to run potential posts by Christopher Daniels, a coach or a member of Legal/HR or PR team before posting.”</p><p>During a live show on Thursday night, <a href=#>Dax Harwood texted CM Punk</a> and asked if he had a message for the fans. Punk replied with “Yes” and “I miss them.”</p><p>Although nothing is confirmed, the news of a possible reconciliation will undoubtedly excite wrestling fans who have been waiting for Punk’s return to the ring. It remains to be seen whether Punk will make his way back to AEW, but it appears that discussions are taking place.</p><p>What do you think about the possibility of CM Punk reconciling with AEW? Do you believe that he will return to the ring?

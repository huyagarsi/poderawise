He is 12 years old and born under the Sagittarius astrological sign. He is an American citizen.</p><p>John Travolta is his father, and Kelly Preston is his mother. Additionally, he has two siblings named Jett and Ella Bleu. Similarly, Benjamin’s father is a well-known actor and singer, while his mother was also an actress and model. Regrettably, his mother died of breast cancer.</p><p>Similarly, his brother, Jett, is no longer with them, having died in 2009. His sibling was diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease and died at the age of sixteen as a result of an acute seizure. Additionally, Travolta’s parents attempted to conceive another child for nearly three years before conceiving Benjamin. His sister, on the other hand, is a film actor and singer.

He must be content to enjoy and live a lavish life with his loved ones while also studying and attending school. He did, however, frequently appear on television programs alongside his parents. However, due to his youth, he does not yet have a career. Similarly, Benjamin was able to make his reluctant television debut on “The Late Show” in a 2015 episode.</p><p>In terms of his father, John Travolta is an actor and singer who rose to prominence in the 1970s. He has appeared in a number of films and television programs, including Welcome Back, Kotter, Carrie, Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Urban Cowboy, Pulp Fiction, Get Shorty, Broken Arrow, Phenomenon, Face/Off, A Civil Action, Primary Colors, and Hairspray.</p><p>Kelly Preston was an American actress and model who appeared in over 60 television and feature films, including Mischief, Twins, Jerry Maguire, and For Love of the Game.

His father, on the other hand is worth $250 million.</p><h2>Benjamin Travolta Girlfriend, Dating</h2><p><strong>Benjamin Travolta</strong> is far too young to be involved in any type of romantic relationship. He must prioritize his education and enjoyment of life over a romantic connection. He does, however, have a sizable following at the moment. And there is no doubt that he will have a girlfriend in the future.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZnqaalrqquoytqZqun6HBons%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boy-george-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boy George Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-ramos-shes-gotta-have-it-season-2-interview-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Ramos on Shes Gotta Have It Season Two, Puerto Rico, and In the Heights</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

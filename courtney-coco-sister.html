David intentionally double-crossed Courtney and Lace, but neither of them was aware of it.</p><p>Burns’ relationship with the two sisters was also more than just romantic. Authorities learned that he was the one who kidnapped and then killed Courtney sixteen years after the terrible death.</p><p>After witnesses reported that David had confessed to killing Courtney while the case was being looked into, the authorities detained David Anthony Burns.</p><p>David’s admission of guilt was allegedly overlooked by the police during the opening phases of the investigation.</p><p>A murderer was permitted to wander the streets unchecked for sixteen years due to a police officer’s carelessness.</p><p>David Anthony Burns was detained and charged in connection with the murder of Courtney Coco in April 2021.</p><p>He was found guilty in October 2022 and given a life sentence without the chance of parole.

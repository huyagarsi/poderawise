On the Monday, May 18 episode of Teen Mom OG, pregnant <strong>Maci Bookout</strong> and her 6-year-old son <strong>Bentley</strong> survived a very serious car accident that put everything in perspective for the anxious mom.&nbsp;</p><p>But things got even worse when she learned that her ex <strong>Ryan Edwards</strong> was also in a car crash and his outlook on the situation was very different.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what happened to each of the girls:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong><a href=#>Maci Bookout</a></strong></p><p>When her Jeep ran into a car with a blown-out tire on the highway, Maci’s car flipped three times with her little boy Bentley in the backseat.&nbsp;</p><p>“I keep having flashbacks and nightmares,” Maci admitted to her boyfriend <strong>Taylor McKinney</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully her baby bun in the oven was doing just fine, and Bentley made it out unscathed. But things got even scarier when Maci learned that her ex <strong>Ryan Edwards </strong>was also involved in a serious accident.&nbsp;</p><p>He agreed to meet up with Maci bringing his reunited girlfriend <strong>Shelby</strong> along to fill the awkward pauses. At first things were civil, but then Ryan admitted that he wasn’t wearing a seatbelt during his accident.&nbsp;</p><p>When Maci asked him if Bentley sits in a car seat in his car, Ryan replied, “Sometimes, not all the time. When I don’t have one, it’s not a big deal because when I was his age, I didn’t wear one. The law says you gotta have one, but I don’t really push the issue.”</p><p>Fresh off her recent accident, this did not fly with the appalled Maci.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Catelynn Lowell</strong></p><p>At the time this was filmed, baby <strong>Novalee</strong> was two months old and spitting up on Mommy’s jacket like a pro. With their wedding just around the corner and 60 pounds of pregnancy weight to lose, Cate was feeling the pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>But as she tried to lose the weight, her concerned fiancé <strong>Tyler Baltierra</strong> was really making things stressful for the self-conscious mom. It all culminated in Catelynn trying on her wedding dress, and being unable to fit it over her boobs. She learned that she’d have to go down four dress sizes to be able to fit into the gown by August.&nbsp;</p><p>“Before Nova, Cate would never finish a plate,” Tyler said at a family dinner. Umm, sometimes mama wants some fried chicken, Ty!&nbsp;</p><p>Catelynn joined Weight Watchers, but that was not enough for Tyler who immediately asked her if she had called the gym.</p><p>“You’re horrible! When you say things that makes me not want to do it even more,” a frustrated Catelynn declared.&nbsp;</p><p>“Should I just let it happen and not say anything?” a confused Tyler replied. &nbsp;“If there’s ways I can support you, I’ll do it. I just need to know how to do it.”&nbsp;</p><p>They talked about tips for how Tyler could approach helping Catelynn.</p><p>“I’m sorry, babe,” Tyler said. “I can’t wait! You’re going to be beautiful no matter what.” That’s the Ty we know and love!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong><a href=#>Farrah Abraham</a></strong></p><p>This week the porn princess’ mom wanted to revamp their Italian pepper sauce business, and invited Farrah to a convention. Yes, there are pepper sauce conventions. &nbsp;</p><p>But with her own books, sex toys, and adult film out, Farrah was not exactly thrilled about the idea of reviving their old family business, especially considering her mom <strong>Debra</strong>’s sketchy past when it came to having her best interests at heart.&nbsp;</p><p>“Even if we did have an agreement in place, I really don’t think things would change between ourselves,” Farrah told her mom. “I’ve already tried to help you do things right, and I don’t think I’m the proper help to do it right with you. And I’m not going to be around somebody who thinks everything is right their way and doesn’t listen to someone else.”</p><p>All of the tension culminated in a massive blowup at <strong>Michael</strong>’s birthday party. Seriously, you guys, poor Michael! Farrah’s dad told her she didn’t have to work with her mom professionally if she didn’t want to, but clearly Debra doesn’t feel the same. Can’t wait for their new mother-daughter therapy show!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong><a href=#>Amber Portwood</a></strong></p><p>Nothing says post-parole party like Vegas! At least that was what Amber Portwood and her new fiancé <strong>Matt Baier</strong> decided. But their celebration quickly turned sour when Ambie got nervous at dinner. Someone was staring at her and her anxiety began to act up.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’re a different person when these cameras come on,” Matt declared.&nbsp;</p><p>That didn’t go over well. Amber got furious and began reverting to her old self.&nbsp;</p><p>“Amber, you have not spoken to me like this… You only do this when these people are around,” Matt continued.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s f—ked up that you would even say that about me,” Amber said. “That I change for the cameras.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Grow up! Can you do that for the cameras?” Matt, who is 19 years her senior, said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Apparently Matt changed after the cameras, because when the team wrapped for the day, he blew up and punched a wall in their hotel room. Then they went to a psychic to see if they could salvage their relationship (because who better, right?).&nbsp;</p><p>The two psychics went back and forth, contradicting themselves before finally declaring, “There is no right path or wrong path there’s just the path you choose.” Wow, thanks for that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> What did you think of this week’s Teen Mom OG?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOrZyepl2ivK55zqBkq52Tlr1uvNGenqeZnql6rq3ComSbp5%2BgvLbAjKysq66Zq7K0ecKaqWabopbAqXmRaWhuaWhq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./53311-beautiful-tswana-names-boys-girls-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>160+ beautiful Tswana names for boys and girls to choose from</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shakiras-abs-are-sculpted-in-post-baby-body-reveal-photo-details-2015169.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shakira's Abs Are Sculpted in Post-Baby Body Reveal: Photo, Details</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

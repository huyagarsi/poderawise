The Big Ten and SEC are increasingly concentrating their power, and the revenue for their member schools is widening the chasm between the haves and have nots.</p><p>Following the newest round of realignment, separating football from the traditional college sports model is equally as inevitable.</p><p>Football teams have the resources to traverse the country for conference games and the travel logistics are easier when teams play once a week. Having teams in non-revenue sports make the same trips simply isn't sustainable.</p><p>Marchand and Mandel outlined how the CST proposal would streamline the rules regarding player movement and compensation as well.</p><p>"While the CST model would eliminate the longtime conference structure for football, it would create one entity to negotiate with a prospective union that would represent the players on NIL, transfer portal and salary structure rules," they reported. "This embrace of collective bargaining could allow it to avoid the antitrust issues that have limited the NCAA's ability to enforce its own rules."</p><p>According to Marchand and Mandel, the idea may not even be able to get off the ground, though. While the ACC board of directors reportedly listened to a presentation from CST officials, the Big Ten, SEC and Big 12 all canceled plans for a similar sit-down.</p><p>ESPN <a href=# rel=noopener>just agreed</a> to a media rights deal for the expanded College Football Playoff, while the SEC and Big Ten aren't close to the expiry of their respective television contracts. It's almost impossible to wrap your head around the logistics behind ripping up the current TV deals and figuring out the broadcasting rights for a two-division college football "Super League."</p><p>If nothing else, this might be the opening salvo in what promises to be a much larger fight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqCcoCMq5ypp6KpeqSywWaqrqiVp3qtscCgrJ5lpKR6s7HPpZicnV2jsKKtjJydqWWSmravs4ydoKybpajAprCMm7Bmq5OdvLC4jKmpnquZmbKvwNI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stars-with-successful-alcohol-brands-ryan-reynolds-diddy-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stars With Successful Alcohol Brands: Ryan Reynolds, Diddy, More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./107291-rapper-2-chainz-celebrates-3rd-wedding-anniversary-wife-kesha-my-best-friend-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rapper 2 Chainz Celebrates 3rd Wedding Anniversary with Wife Kesha: My Best Friend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

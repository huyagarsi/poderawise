Knight, who he will face at the Royal Rumble premium live event on Saturday in his first televised match since returning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Reigns has been world champion for nearly 900 days, and he will put his titles on the line at Royal Rumble when he takes on Kevin Owens.</p><p>Since Reigns and Wyatt were in developmental together in FCW, and were called up to the main roster within less than a year of one another in 2012 and 2013, they have mixed it up on numerous occasions.</p><p>One of the first notable instances was when the Wyatt-led Wyatt Family defeated Reigns and his Shield brethren at Elimination Chamber 2014.</p><p>They had several singles matches against each other on television and at house shows, but only two one-on-one bouts at premium live events, with the most recent one being at Hell in a Cell 2015.</p><p>Their interactions were even more limited once Wyatt transitioned to The Fiend character, as they didn't mix it up aside from Reigns beating The Fiend and Braun Strowman at Payback 2020 to win the Universal Championship.</p><p>Since Wyatt's programs rely so heavily on unique storytelling mechanics and supernatural elements, it can be difficult for his opponents to shine and improve their standing.</p><p>Reigns is already firmly established as WWE's top star, so that may not be something he has to worry about, but a feud with Wyatt would be unlike anything he has done thus far during his world title reign.</p><p>It doesn't seem like Reigns vs. Wyatt is going to happen any time soon, but given that they are two of the most popular Superstars that WWE has to offer, it is likely inevitable that they will cross paths again at some point.</p><p><i>Listen to Ring Rust Radio for all of the hot wrestling topics.

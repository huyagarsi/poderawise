Now that I'm at or around that age where menopause is one of those stages, I started realizing there was not a lot I personally knew about it, and I was so happy I had the opportunity to not only learn more myself so I could work with other women, but to do it in a way that was funny and create this video with Pfizer for their 'Let's Talk About Change Campaign.'"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1317871181.jpg><p><span>Kate Walsh played Olivia Baker on the first three seasons of the show.

Lemon is great because the alkaline balances your body. I feel like I'm winning if I drink one of these [jugs] a day, plus a couple more glasses. This will make you do it. It's like a giant sippy cup. Nikki Glaser is like, 'You actually bring your own water cooler—we're having a water cooler conversation right now because you brought yours with you.'"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1386847946-2.jpg><p><span>Alisha Boe played Jessica Davis on the show.

She revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Backstage.com</span></a><span> that she believes in saying no to things. "It's about saying no, too. I've had to say no to a lot of things that just didn't resonate with me. I was like, 'You know what? The right thing for me is gonna come. And I'm gonna believe in that.' In this industry, you're going to hear a lot of rejection, as well. And that's OK. That kind of builds character, and it also sets you on a path for success. Because the universe is just lining you up for exactly what is meant for you. And just have fun! We're telling stories! It's the arts! We're having fun!

"I've gotten a lot of help from other people when I didn't feel like I could talk to my friends or family.

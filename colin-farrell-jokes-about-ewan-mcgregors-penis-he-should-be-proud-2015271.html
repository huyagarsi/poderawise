I’d done Shallow Grave. We were all kicking off. It was happening.”</p><p>The Son of a Gun actor noted to the mag that he and his fellow rising stars at the time “were having a right laugh.” Without divulging any specific details, McGregor reflected: “It [was] the ’90s in London. It was quite fun… That’s all you’re getting.”</p><p>The Trainspotting actor also spoke about possibly reprising his role as Renton in the rumored sequel of the film. “He’s now a Glaswegian running a gym in Amsterdam,” McGregor told Nylon. “I haven’t seen a script or anything, but it seemed to be quite real. I spoke to Danny [Boyle] about it. I met him randomly in a restaurant [last year] before he went up to Scotland to sit with our writer John Hodge and Andrew Macdonald, the producer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As for possibly tackling another famous past role — as Obi-Wan in Star Wars? While the actor insisted that he would be happy to don Obi-Wan’s suit again, McGregor compared the process of shooting a blockbuster film to “watching paint dry.” He added that nobody from <strong>J.J. Abrams</strong>‘ upcoming Star Wars reboot asked him to reprise his role or even make a cameo. “They didn’t ask me to do anything in it,” McGregor told the mag.</p><p>According to the actor, nothing in his career compares to the joy of fatherhood. “I’ve been a dad for 18 years. Your work reflects your life, and the biggest element of my life is that I’m a dad,” McGregor confessed. “That’s the most important thing of all.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The father of four daughters — <strong>Clara, Jamyan, Esther</strong>, and <strong>Anouk</strong> — added that he’s unfortunately unable to share one of his lifelong passions, riding motorcycles, with this family.</p><p>“My wife would absolutely kill me,” McGregor mused of <strong>Eve Mavrakis</strong>, his spouse of 18 years, discovering that he was still riding bikes. “That’s the one thing — that and tattoos. Clara, my eldest, started talking about tattoos. I said, ‘Dude, I got my tattoo when I was 30 years old. You’re 17? 18? I can assure you that what you think you want on your arm now isn’t what you’re going to want on your arm when you’re my age. Don’t do it.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The <a href=#>February/March 2015 issue of Nylon</a> hits stands on Feb. 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaJqopJmjeqet0aucpaRdn7yssdJmmJunpal6psPAp2Smm5ensqi70axkqZ2ensButMRmqqGnpaGxbq7EZqerp6WZenN8kG5pcGk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./has-skurry-done-a-face-reveal-what-is-the-real-name-of-twitch-star-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Has Skurry Done A Face Reveal?

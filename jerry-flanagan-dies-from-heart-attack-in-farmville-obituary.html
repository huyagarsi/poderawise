His commitment to making a positive impact remained steadfast throughout his life, earning him a reputation as a pillar of the Farmville community.</p><p>Kristy Ross shared a <a href=# rel=noopener>post on fb</a>:</p><p>This one’s hard. Just last week he had me all emotional telling the story about finding out he wasn’t bulletproof. I always thought he was. Or a few years ago when he told me detailed stories of a pig he gave his kids and its demise…the whole time I was saying “please Jerry, don’t say the rest.” Or 25 years ago when I watched bulls being castrated. One particular bull stomped on one of his parts, and I remember my reaction when Jerry picked it up and said “well that one ain’t edible”.</p><p>I’m so lucky to have so many memories of him over the last 30 years of my life. The manliest man I’ve ever known with the kindest heart. An amazing cook who’d eat absolutely anything and gross me out. And the best story teller ever. RIP Jerry Flanagan. You’re going to be missed tremendously.</p><p>Tributes poured in on social media, with friends and acquaintances remembering Jerry as a generous, dependable, and driven individual. Michelle Myers expressed the profound impact Jerry had on her family, emphasizing his willingness to lend a helping hand.

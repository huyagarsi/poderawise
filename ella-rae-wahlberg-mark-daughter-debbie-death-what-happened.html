He has been a protective dad and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even accompanied his daughter Ella Rae on a date</a>. Regardless of how uncool it is that her father is publicly sharing details about her dating life, Ella Rae still seems to be quite the daddy’s girl.</p><p>However, the father-and-daughter relationship is not always rainbows and butterflies. A “bittersweet” memory lingers in the family, especially to Mark and Ella Rae. The actor, <a href=#>who landed a role in the Transformers universe</a>, uploaded a photo of himself with his daughter on her 18th birthday on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The photo of the two followed by a picture of him and his late sister, Debbie. Ella Rae Wahlberg, Mark’s first child, was born on September 2, 2003, the same day that his sister Debbie Wahlberg died. On the caption, he wrote, “Happy B day my Ella 18 years old.”</p><p>Along with a red heart, gift, and bow emojis, he continued writing, “Wow how time flies. So proud of you !!” In the other photo, Mark could be seen wrapping his arms around his late sister, which appears to be taken in the late 80s or early 90s. He added, along with prayer and red hear emojis, “Always A bitter Sweet day. Missing my big sister Debbie. Ella’s Guardian angel.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>19 Facts About Mark Wahlberg Fans Choose To Ignore</a></span></p><p>So much for the celebration of his daughter’s birthday, Mark couldn’t avoid the sad truth that it was also the day his beloved sister died. After honoring his sister’s life and his daughter’s day, his post garnered comments from some celebrities, including Jeremy Renner, Mariano Rivera, and Mario Lopez, wishing Ella Rae a happy birthday.</p><p>His wife, Rhea Durham, also replied, using the crying emoji and the Latin cross emoji to memorialize Debbie 18 years after her death. She also used a heart emoji to express her love for her and Mark's daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Fans Need To Know About Mark Wahlberg And Rhea Durham’s Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-mark-rsquo-s-sister-debbie>What Happened To Mark’s Sister Debbie?</h2><p>Debbie died of a heart attack on September 2, at the young age of 43. She was said to have a kidney stone that she was about to have surgically removed. However, difficulties arose as a result of an infection. She died after suffering a heart attack.</p><p>Mark Wahlberg, the youngest of nine siblings, including Donnie and Robert Wahlberg, has previously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoken up about Debbie's death</a> and the impact it had on their family. The actor said in a 2019 interview with ET Canada that her death was "devastating" for Wahlberg's family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said, "My mom really went into a big, deep depression after my sister passed away...it was a real jolt to her. It was completely devastating. She lost her first-born daughter and was so crushed, so that set her back more. She became more lost."</p><p>The actor continued saying, “It was the same day as the birth of my daughter. It was a long time ago, but no parent should have to lose a child.” His mother Alma grieved after the death of Debbie, but Mark claims that filming their famous reality show, Wahlburgers, based on the family's gourmet burger shop, helped her heal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He revealed, "Once my sister departed, it was incredibly difficult for her. The restaurant has given her a new beginning and a new lease on life, and that has made her happy.” He further added, “She's (his mother Alma) a real people person and retreated [from working in their family restaurant] a little after my sister passed away, but being at the restaurants — shaking hands, connecting with people — and then being on the show, she found her voice again.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Mark's elder brother Paul said, “The show's been really good for her (Alma)...She fell in love with all the people who worked on it — she would have them over for dinner and she still keeps in touch with them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2021, <a href=#>Mark Wahlberg’s mother Alma also passed away</a>. He and his brother Donnie did not reveal the cause of her death in their public post to announce the devastating news, but in previous interviews, Donnie has opened up about his mom’s battle with dementia.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here’s How Mark Wahlberg Heats Things Up With His Wife After 12 Years Of Marriage</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaSRYr%2BisYywmKGkkpq%2FqHnMmqmkZZSWwqi0056pZpyVl6%2BqsYydnJqsmGLEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./watch-new-rogue-one-clip-star-wars-story-stormtroopers-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Felicity Jones Whup Stormtroopers in New Rogue One Clip</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-pogba-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Pogba Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Girlfriend Maria Salaues</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

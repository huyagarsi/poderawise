Zsa Zsa died in December 2016 at the age of 99.&nbsp; Zsa Zsa Gabor began her career on the stage in Vienna. In 1936 she was crowned Miss Hungary. She immigrated to the United States in the early 40s, and went on to appear in numerous films and television programs from the 50s through the 90s. Some of her notable films include "Lovely to Look At", "We're Not Married!", "Moulin Rouge", "Death of a Scoundrel", "The Girl in the Kremlin", and "Touch of Evil". She appeared on several TV shows, including "Playhouse 90", "Matinee Theater", "Gilligan's Island", "The Love Boat", "The Facts of Life", "Life of Riley" and "Batman".</p><p>Beyond her acting, Gabor earned notoriety for her ostentatious lifestyle and nine marriages. Her first marriage lasted from 1937 to 1941. She was then married to Hilton Hotel founder <a href=#>Conrad Hilton</a> from 1942 to 1947. They had a daughter in 1947 whom they named Constance Francesca Gabor Hilton. Constance, who commonly went by her second name, <a href=#>Francesca Hilton</a>, would be Zsa Zsa's only child. Decades later Zsa Zsa would claim the child was conceived after a rape by Conrad. <a href=# title="Paris Hilton Net Worth">Paris Hilton</a> and <a href=# title="Nicky Hilton Net Worth">Nicky Hilton</a> would therefore be Francesca's great-nieces and Zsa Zsa's former great-great-nieces by marriage, though this relationship basically is discounted by Zsa Zsa and Conrad's 1947 divorce. Gabor later took her daughter to court over accusations of fraud but the actress never appeared.</p><p>She was married to <a href=#>Frederic Prinz von Anhalt</a> from 1986 until her death in 2016.</p><p>She made headlines in 1989 for slapping a police officer after she was pulled over while driving and later for being involved in a car crash that left her in a wheelchair in 2002. Years later, Gabor suffered several strokes, required hip replacement surgery and a leg amputation.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Zsa Zsa Gabor was born on February 6, 1917 in Budapest, Austria-Hungary as the middle of three daughters of Jewish parents Jolie and Vilmos. Her older sister Magda went on to become a socialite in the United States, while her younger sister Eva became an American actress and businesswoman.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>In 1934, Gabor was discovered by operatic tenor Richard Tauber in Vienna; he subsequently invited her to sing in his operetta "Der Singende Traum" at the Theater an der Wien. Later, in 1936, Gabor won the title of Miss Hungary. She ultimately ended up leaving the country in 1941, three years before the Nazi takeover. An Ã©migrÃ© in the United States in the 40s, she co-wrote the novel "Every Man for Himself" with Victoria Wolf.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-265476 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/GettyImages-3228064.jpeg alt width=900 height=704 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-265476 class=wp-caption-text>Nixon/Express/Getty Images</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>Gabor first appeared on the big screen in 1952.

Later, in both 2005 and 2007, she survived strokes. In 2010, Gabor was admitted to the hospital in serious condition; the next year, she had her leg amputated to save her from a life-threatening infection. She was hospitalized again the same year, and fell into a coma.</p><p>Just days before her 99th birthday in 2016, Gabor was admitted to the hospital with breathing problems. While in a coma later in the year, she passed away from cardiac arrest at the age of 99. In 2021, husband Prinz von Anhalt had Gabor's remains interred in Budapest, fulfilling her desire to return to Hungary.</p><h2 id=bel-air-mansion><strong>Bel Air Mansion</strong></h2><p>In 1973 Zsa Zsa paid $245,000 for a mansion on 1.1-acres in Bel Air. That's the same as around $1.435 million in today's dollars after adjusting for inflation. In 2012 the home used as a stand-in for <a href=# title="Liberace Net Worth">Liberace</a>'s Vegas mansion in the <a href=# title="Michael Douglas Net Worth">Michael Douglas</a>/<a href=# title="Matt Damon Net Worth">Matt Damon</a> HBO movie "Behind the Candelabra". The home sold three times between Zsa Zsa's death in 2016 and 2020. In 2011 she listed it for $15 million.

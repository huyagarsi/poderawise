Our hearts go out to his family and friends and we ask that you respect their privacy during this time.”</p><p>The victim, who was 31 at the time of his death, was a parking enforcement worker, according to police reports. He was sitting in a car on the show’s New York set in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, around 5:15 a.m. when he was shot. Forty-five minutes later, after being rushed to the hospital, he was pronounced dead. The man has not yet been identified pending family notification, per <a href=#>Deadline</a>. Production has been shut down for the rest of the day.</p><p>The tragedy occurred two months before the premiere of <a href=#>the procedural drama’s third season</a>, which is set to air in September.</p><p>The spinoff series features <a href=#><strong>Christopher Meloni</strong> </a>as Detective Elliott Stabler (in a crossover role from Law & Order: Special Victims Unit) and <strong>Danielle Moné Truitt</strong> as Sergeant Ayanna Bell. <strong>Ainsley Seiger</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Dylan McDermott</strong></a>, <strong>Mike Cannon</strong>, <strong>Rachel Lin</strong>, <strong>Ellyn Burstein</strong> and more also star. Stabler’s right-hand woman, Captain Olivia Benson — who has been portrayed by SVU lead <a href=#><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong></a> for more than 20 years — has appeared on 10 episodes of the spinoff.</p><p>The premise of the show revolves around Stabler’s new position at the Organized Crime Task Force, where he desperately searches for his wife’s killers.</p><p>Meloni, 61, initially exited SVU after 2011’s season 12 and has no regrets. In terms of how much he missed the series — on which he portrayed Stabler for 13 years — the Washington, D.C. native revealed: “Zero.”</p><p>“I would have no problem admitting to it. But I was pleasantly surprised it played out as well as it did,” the actor, who went on to star on True Blood and The Handmaid’s Tale, told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2021. “I must say, the intervening decade was everything I could have hoped for.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Law-and-Order-Organized-Crime-Crew-Member-Shot-and-Killed-on-Set-2.jpg><p>Ten years after his departure, however, Meloni not only returned to SVU — but was back with his own show: Organized Crime. What made him decide to step into Stabler’s shoes a decade later?</p><p>“When [<a href=#>L&O creator <strong>Dick Wolf</strong></a>] pitched this more serialized expression of his latest idea of a Law & Order show, the OC, I really thought it was kind of a stroke of genius,” the Man of Steel star revealed at the TCA Summer Press Tour in September 2021. “I didn’t think that was even anything he was thinking about. I was pleasantly pleased and surprised and excited when I got the pitch and it was just on the basis of the type of storytelling that the OC allows us. I just think it allows for a little more in-depth analysis of characters and relationships and that kind of stuff.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As soon as he put on his beloved character’s badge, Meloni told EW, he immediately knew he was back where he was supposed to be.</p><p>“It felt great, a surprising sense of freedom,” the NBC star shared. “It was a very interesting feeling because I rarely get it. It was just kind of a weird sign that everything’s right, and I was where I belonged.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmadivLOwxKtkqKqXlruqxsSdZJyqmaKybrHMqaOosZWaeqW1xKxkmp6kmr9ursSipaBlo528tXnOp2SsnaRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-did-amazon-pay-garth-brooks-will-garth-brooks-ever-be-on-apple-music.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How much did Amazon pay Garth Brooks?

However, the “lifetime” of the product is often not defined, and it can vary depending on the manufacturer. For example, a lifetime warranty on a watch might mean the lifetime of the watch movement, which could be 20 years or more. A lifetime warranty on a car might mean the lifetime of the original owner, which could be 10 years or less.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_my_Pampered_Chef_stone_broke_in_the_oven></span>Why did my Pampered Chef stone broke in the oven?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Difference between Warranty and Guarantee <b>People associate the term ‘guarantee’ with a full refund or replacement of the product itself, whereas a warranty often points in the direction of repairs and maintenance to the same product.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_lifetime_warranty_really_lifetime></span>Is lifetime warranty really lifetime?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stoneware is durable but not indestructible.

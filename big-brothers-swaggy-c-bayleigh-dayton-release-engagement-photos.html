To celebrate, the couple released some of the stunning shots from their recent engagement photo shoot.</p><p>“My love for you is unconditional,” the day trader (real name Chris Williams) wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Sunday, June 16. “This year was a tough one, at first I genuinely didn’t understand why we were under so much persecution but I’ve quickly realized that saying your [sic] a ride or die and actually being one are two separate things. Babe, without any doubts I know that you will ride for me, just like I will ride for you, because you have been!”</p><p>He continued, “Relationships mean nothing until they stand the tests and trials that try to break them down. & Now that we’ve been through just about every hard thing, I know our love was built to last! Now let’s move forward on to bigger, better and brighter things. I love you Mr. Williams. #SwayleighWedding #Meettheswaggys #blacklove #couplesgoals #engagement.”</p><p>The flight attendant, for her part, took a moment to honor her fiancé’s late father and the baby that she and Swaggy <a href=#>conceived in the Big Brother house</a> before she <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage</a>.</p><p>“I thought it would be special to begin to release our official engagement photos today on Father’s day 1. Because I know your dad is looking down at you smiling and nodding with approval but 2. To also highlight what would have been your first Father’s Day,” she wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “@swaggyctv I know how much your relationship with your father meant to you & I know that losing him is something you will never get past. I know that you would have been and still will be the best father ever! A lot of times people only care about my feelings surrounding the miscarriage and never really acknowledge your disappointment or think about you.”</p><p>She added, “So, I am taking this time to say Happy Father’s Day to all the fathers out there but also to all the men that are loving & supporting women who have had miscarriages or infertility issues, your rainbow will come stay strong fatherhood is for you just keep hope alive.”</p><p>Swaggy, 24, proposed to Bayleigh, 26, during the season 20 finale in September 2018. After spending several weeks apart — he was evicted early on in the game, while she spent her summer in the Big Brother and jury houses — Swaggy <a href=#>got down on bended knee</a> and told Bayleigh, “I want you and only you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swayleigh’s spokesman, Thom Brodeur-Kazanjian, said they hope to marry in September. They have looked at a number of venues in the Northeast, but have also been spotted scouting locations in the Caribbean.</p><p><a href=#>Big Brother season 21</a> premieres on CBS Tuesday, June 25, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down to see the stunning shots from the couple’s photo shoot, taken by Nick Allen Photography.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6qzjJupqKyYmr%2B0edKwmKCfqWKwbq7AsqOeoZedeqWt2K2mp2WimrmmrdKeZJ6ml5a0prnEp6tmqJikwbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10120073-duke-cbb-transfer-tj-power-commits-to-virginia-5-star-pf-prospect-in-2023-class.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Duke CBB Transfer TJ Power Commits to Virginia; 5-Star PF Prospect in 2023 Class | News, Scores, Hig</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./155995-12-quotes-from-sense-and-sensibility-by-jane-austen.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>12 Quotes From 'Sense And Sensibility' By Jane Austen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

He <a href=# rel=noopener>added</a> that agents were consistently trying to contact him as he negotiated his new deal with Baltimore.</p><p>Jackson's self-representation was a major storyline. According to Adam Schefter of ESPN (via ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jamison Hensley</a>), the NFL alerted its teams that "a person not certified by the NFLPA might be attempting to persuade team personnel to enter into contract negotiations with Jackson."</p><p>The quarterback <a href=# rel=noopener>denied</a> reports someone was negotiating on his behalf.</p><p>Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta told <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike Florio</a> of Pro Football Talk that Jackson was "a good agent" who "asks the right questions" and is "aware of different mechanisms and issues with the contract, language terms, types of structures and things like that."</p><p>He must have done something right in negotiations because he <a href=#>agreed</a> to a five-year, $260 million contract extension with $185 million guaranteed. It came in higher than the $255 million contract Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts agreed to in April and made him the NFL's highest-paid player.</p><p>Attention will turn to the field as Jackson looks to bounce back from the knee injury that forced him to miss the final five regular-season games and a Wild Card Round loss to the Cincinnati Bengals last season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2mGdn6MpZimmaJit6Kvyqymp2WnnrmtecKopa2hnqqybsDOZqmeqF2dtq6%2FxKWdZpmWqbKzedGarZ6mo2KwsLrTq5icrF2svK%2FAjKGgq51dlrSmutM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leslie-bricusse-willy-wonka-and-goldfinger-songwriter-dead-at-90.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leslie Bricusse, Willy Wonka and Goldfinger songwriter, dead at 90</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./john-paxson-wife-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>John Paxson: Wife, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carrot-top-net-worth.html>Carrot Top Net Worth How Much is Carrot Top Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garret-5-letters-crossword-clue-1112807.html>Garret 5 Letters Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rapper-quavo-among-those-aboard-miami-yacht-during-reported-robbery.html>Rapper Quavo Among Those Aboard Miami Yacht During Reported Robbery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-tj-holmes-steamy-kiss.html>Amy Robach and T.J.

He seemed to be enjoying the sport after the breakup when he was still in California, where he posted a video on his skateboard near the Walt Disney concert hall.</p><p>After moving to Grand Rapids, Michigan, Nathan continued to showcase his skateboarding on social media. In March 2020, Schwandt posted a photo where he was rock climbing a wall in Michigan. He captioned it, "Might have found a new hobby." During that time, <a href=#>new facts related to Jeffree Star's relationship with Nathan were still unfolding.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=schwandt-cozied-up-with-weed><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Schwandt Cozied Up With Weed</span></h2><p>Nathan has been smoking weed since 1999. Moreover, since Michigan legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2018, Schwandt has been revealing his love for the plant.

Some fans were speculating whether Schwandt is considering starting a new weed business or if he is just enjoying it for fun.</p><h2 id=nathan-walked-away-with-an-attractive-new-style><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nathan Walked Away With An Attractive New Style</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before dating Jeffree Star, Nathan worked as a pet shop employee in Michigan.

However, after meeting and dating Jeffree Star, <a href=#>Nathan transformed his looks</a>, started wearing luxury brands, dying his hair in fancy colors such as blue and green, taking care of his skin, and took his overall style to another level.

As Jeffree explained back then, Schwandt wanted to "detach" from this social world. Moreover, Nathan and Jeffree liked to DM people on social media for fun. As a result, fans would screenshot all of their conversations, circulate them and make a big story about them, which annoyed Nathan and pushed him to deactivate his Instagram and Snapchat accounts.</p><p>However, after the breakup, Nathan joined Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and other social media channels again.

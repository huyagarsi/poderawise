The 22-year-old died early on Sunday in a South Korean hospital as a result of complications from several cosmetic procedures he had to resemble Jimin, a well-known member of the K-pop band BTS.</p><p>In order to play the singer for a US streaming network, Von Colucci reportedly paid $220,000 on 12 plastic procedures to look like Jimin. On Saturday, the actor underwent surgery to remove jaw implants he had placed in November. However, difficulties led to an infection, and despite being intubated, he passed just a short while later.</p><p>Von Colucci relocated from Canada to South Korea in 2019 to seek a career in the music business, according to his representative, Eric Blake. Nonetheless, the sad event has sparked worries about the risks of celebrity devotion and its effects on mental health.</p><h3>His Appearance Instilled A Great Deal Of Insecurity In Himbottom Of Form</h3><p>Saint Von Colucci, a Canadian actor who died at the age of 22, was “extremely insecure” about his appearance, according to his publicist Eric Blake.
